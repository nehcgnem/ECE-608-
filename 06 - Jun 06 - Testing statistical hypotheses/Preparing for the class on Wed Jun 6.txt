In preparation for the class on Wed Jun 6, please complete Activites 1-3, 6, 8, 9-13, 15-19 from K&S Chapter 6.
Submit your work in one file named "KS-Ch6.R". In the file, use a comment for the part related to each activity.
The data for Table 6.1 is in a file called "C6 Table 6.1.csv". You will need the "rownames" argument to "read.csv" to best input this dataset.

For questions like Activity 1 which require a word answer, include it as a comment.
For questions like Activity 2 which require calculating a number, store it in an appropriately named environment variable.

I found it helpful before Activity 1 to reproduce the table on the console ("print") using "as.table", "as.matrix", and "addmargins".
Some other functions which I found useful were "prop.table", "barplot", "phyper", and "chisq.test".
