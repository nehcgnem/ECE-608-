In preparing for class on Wed Jun 13, I think the core reading in K&S Chapter 3 is 3.1-3.7 and 3.11. 
Some more of the concepts in multiple regression will be covered in the Rossi chapter for next week.

Please complete Activities 1-3 and 7-13.
Where it mentions the solution to Activity 5, use the model Price ~ Cyl + Doors + Cruise + Sound + Leather + Mileage
Submit using the file name "KS-Ch3.R".
