#38.10     35.55 

#In addition 
t.test(Time ~ Type, data=game_data, conf.level=.95)
#data:  x and y
#t = 2.2862, df = 37.795, p-value = 0.02794
#alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
#95 percent confidence interval:
#  0.2916224 4.8083776
#sample estimates:
#  mean of x mean of y 
#38.10     35.55 

#The actual difference between two type is 2.55 
#which is within the 95% confidence interval 
#the null hypothesis can't be rejected.

#From the P value indicates a likelyhood of 0.02794 that a random chance alone would 
#create a difference between two sample means (y1 - y2) at least as large 
#as the one observed.
